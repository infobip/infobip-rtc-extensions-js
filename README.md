## Introduction

Infobip RTC extensions is a JavaScript library which provides extended functionality to Infobip RTC SDK.

Currently available functionalities are:

- audio filter implementations
- video filter implementations

Here you will find an overview, and a quick guide on how to include and use these extensions in your application.
There is also in-depth reference documentation available.

## Prerequisites

Infobip RTC Extensions requires ES6.

## Getting the library

There are a few ways in which you can get our library.
We publish it as an NPM package and as a standalone JS file hosted on a CDN.

If you want to add it as an NPM dependency, run the following:

```bash
npm install infobip-rtc-extensions --save
```

After which you would use it in your project like this:

```javascript
let infobipRtcExtensions = require('infobip-rtc-extensions');
```

or as ES6 import:

```javascript
import {VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter} from "infobip-rtc-extensions"
```

You can include our distribution file in your JavaScript from our CDN:

```html
<script src="//rtc.cdn.infobip.com/0.0.10/infobip.rtc.extensions.js"></script>
```

The latest tag is also available:

```html
<script src="//rtc.cdn.infobip.com/latest/infobip.rtc.extensions.js"></script>
```

## Audio filters

The Infobip RTC supports user-defined audio filters which manipulate outgoing audio streams during a call. This library
implements several audio filters which are easy to configure and use.

Filters which are currently available are:

- BackgroundMusicAudioFilter
- NoiseSuppressionFilter

### BackgroundMusicAudioFilter

`BackgroundMusicAudioFilter` allows the user to specify audio to be played alongside their outgoing stream. This audio is heard by other participants of the call, but not by the user.

To use this filter, an instance of
[`BackgroundMusicAudioFilter`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/BackgroundMusicAudioFilter) needs to be created. The only parameter of the class constructor is a string containing the URL of the audio file which is to be combined with the user's outgoing stream. The audio file loops until the filter is turned off or the call is terminated.

```javascript
const musicURL = "path/to/desired/audio.mp3";

const backgroundMusicFilter = new BackgroundMusicAudioFilter(musicURL);
```

### NoiseSuppressionFilter

The `NoiseSuppressionFilter` enhances speech by removing several types of background noise. This filter works in real-time.
Currently, it is focused on removing background noises commonly encountered in call centers, such as babble, noise produced by different 
devices (e.g. air conditioner) and keyboard typing sounds. However, it performs well on a wider range of noise types. It is also independent
of the language spoken.

Since noise suppression uses a neural network, a deep learning model needs to be loaded into the filter.
The model consists of two files: 
- `model.json` - a JSON which contains metadata describing the model
- `group1-shard1of1.bin` - a binary file containing model data

To use the noise suppression filter, an instance of the class 
[`NoisesuppressionFilter`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/NoiseSuppressionFilter) needs to be created.
Its constructor accepts a single parameter - a string containing a URL of the `model.json` file. The binary file is then automatically
loaded, which is possible only if it is available at the same location as the JSON.

Model files are available at our CDN:
- `model.json` at https://d217hhmiwkst9z.cloudfront.net/noise-suppression-tfjs-model/latest/model.json
- `group1-shard1of1.bin` at https://d217hhmiwkst9z.cloudfront.net/noise-suppression-tfjs-model/latest/group1-shard1of1.bin

If you wish to use our CDN directly, it suffices to pass the first URL to the constructor. Another possibility is to download both files
and host them. When doing so, both files must be available at the same path (see example code).

Real-time noise suppression is a hardware-intensive process, so not all hardware will be able to sustain it. In case of insufficient performance,
the filter is automatically disabled in order to not interfere with the call.

```javascript
const modelURL = "https://www.example-cdn.com/noise-suppression-model/model.json";
// group1-shard1of1.bin must be available at https://www.example-cdn.com/noise-suppression-model/group1-shard1of1.bin

const noiseSupressionFilter = new NoiseSuppressionFilter(modelURL);
```

## Video filters

The Infobip RTC supports user-defined video filters which manipulate outgoing video streams while in call. This library
provides a feature-rich implementation of commonly used video filters which allow easy configuration.

Currently available implementations are:

- VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter

### VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter

This filter allows you to alter your background.

Supported video filter modes are:

- Virtual background
  ([`VideoFilterMode.VIRTUAL_BACKGROUND`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VideoFilterMode#virtual-background))
  \- Set a custom image to be drawn behind you as your background
- Background blur
  ([`VideoFilterMode.BACKGROUND_BLUR`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VideoFilterMode#background-blur))
  \- Blur your background
- Face Framing ([`VideoFilterMode.FACE_TRACK`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VideoFilterMode#face-track))
  \- Initiate face framing
- None ([`VideoFilterMode.NONE`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VideoFilterMode#none)) - No
  video filtering, just pass video frames as-is. Prefer this over destroying the video filter to avoid repeatedly
  reallocating video filter resources, which can cause visible hiccups.

To be able to use it, first you need to create an instance
of [`VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter)
object. The constructor accepts optional
[`VirtualBackgroundVideoFilterOptions`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-extensions-js/wiki/VirtualBackgroundVideoFilterOptions)
to be set.

```javascript
const options = {
    mode: VideoFilterMode.VIRTUAL_BACKGROUND,
    image: sourceImage // can be an instance of ImageBitmap, ImageData, HTMLImageElement, â€¦
};

const videoFilter = new VirtualBackgroundVideoFilter(options);
```

For best performance, avoid reallocating new video filter instances just to change the current mode. Pass the new
options to the existing video filter instance:

```javascript
const options = {
    mode: VideoFilterMode.NONE
};

await videoFilter.setOptions(options);
``` 

### Applying the video filter

After you created the video filter, you can apply it to the
existing [`ApplicationCall`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/ApplicationCall) using
the [`setVideoFilter`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/ApplicationCall#set-video-filter) method:

```javascript
let videoFilter = createVideoFilterImplementation();
await applicationCall.setVideoFilter(videoFilter);
```

Another way to set the filter is through
the [`VideoOptions`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/VideoOptions)
in [`CallOptions`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/CallOptions) object when
making [`ApplicationCall`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/ApplicationCall) via
the [`callApplication`](https://github.com/infobip/infobip-rtc-js/wiki/InfobipRTC#call-application) method:

```javascript
let infobipRTC = new InfobipRTC('2e29c3a0-730a-4526-93ce-cda44556dab5', {debug: true});
infobipRTC.connect();

let callOptions = CallOptions.builder().setVideo(true).setVideoFilter(() => createVideoFilterImplementation()).build()
let applicationCall = infobipRTC.callApplication('45g2gql9ay4a2blu55uk1628', callOptions);
```
